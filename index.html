        Asphodel</i> is a game intended to collect data for a scientific study run by students at the Berkeley School of Information.  All data from user behavior is anonymized and only collected from this webpage. <br>
        This game is a modified version of Linjat, originally designed and written by  <a href="https://www.snellman.net/"> Juho Snellman</a>. Source on <a href="https://github.com/jsnell/linjat">GitHub</a>.  Credit also goes to <a href="https://github.com/mmazzarolo"> Matteo Mazzarolo</a>, who wrote and designed a very cool version of Linjat that can be downloaded on both iOS and Android. Find his version here on <a href="https://github.com/mmazzarolo/ordinary-puzzles-app">GitHub</a>.  Neither of these games are affiliated with this study, and neither track any sort of user behavior whatsoever; we highly encourage you to check their games out! <br>
